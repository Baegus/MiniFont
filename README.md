# [MiniFont - Remove unused glyphs from font files](https://minifont.baegus.cz)
A simple web tool to minify font files by removing unused glyphs, with instant live preview.

The tool supports importing and exporting all common webfont formats thanks to [Typr.js](https://github.com/photopea/Typr.js).

Try it out online at [MiniFont.Baegus.cz](https://minifont.baegus.cz)!

## How it works
Just drag and drop your font file anywhere on the page and it will immediately show all the available characters. You can then copy the characters that you need into the *Characters to keep* text field (or just select one of the handy presets).

The tool also always immediately displays the new minified filesize.

By using the *Keep all characters* preset, this tool can also be used to **convert fonts to different formats**
